Automatic Longitudinal Hippocampal Atrophy

ALOHA is a software package for estimating longitudinal atrophy rates in the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal
lobe structures in the human brain. It utilizes a deformation-based morphometry pipeline based on ANTs (http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/),
convert3d (http://www.itksnap.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Convert3D.Documentation), and other open-source image analysis
tools.
